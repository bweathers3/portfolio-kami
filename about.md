I am a long time professional swimming coach who is venturing off on a second career as a software engineer and web designer. My fascination for coding started early in high school and college. So it is which great excitement that I look forward to a new career which will combine my love for daily learning with the challenge of a quickly growing field. The opportunities for daily learning in a fast moving field will keep my professional life fresh and enjoyable for many years to come.

Though I am starting fresh with a new career, I want to carry with me lessons learned from successful times as a coaching, an athletic administrator and exercise scientist.

As a coach I was fortunate to lead a variety of great athletes on teams which range in size from few athletes to very large, over 600. Yet perhaps the successes I enjoyed most were with teams where the team was small, the financial resources were few and it was myself and the athletes with no other staff. One such team, at Southern Illinois, finished 5th in the Division I NCAA championships. What I learned in these smaller environments was simple; you can achieve great things in any situation if team members are willing to take responsibility for their own role, success and the success of the team.

During my career I have had the pleasure to also serve as an athletic director and a small college, as the technical director / national team director for a small country and the executive head coach for a large club which won three national titles. In those roles I have had the opportunity to work with a lot of great coaches. Who I have learned time and time again is that a key to success in any venture is planning. Most people spend far too little time in planning before starting any professional task. That brings me to my second lesson which I know will serve me well in my further career; if you fail to plan you plan to fail.

My final observation comes from my life as a sports scientist and small business owner. As such I quickly realized that there are hundreds of technologies and ideas in every field which are left on the shelf every day.  The best resources and ideas are one which people can understand quick and put into practice on a regular and consistent basis. So my final lesson but bring with me is simple; keep the user facing resources simple and handy to use, our job is to handle the difficult and complex for our clients.

So as I start this new journey I plan to go forward using three simple truths:

1)	If you fail to plan you plan to fail.

2)	A simple and effective idea or resource is always more effective than a complex tool which is too difficult to use on a daily basis.

3)	Be responsible for your own success and the success of those around you – the best way to do that is simple – know your role and do it well.
